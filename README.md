### Keeper:

A react Application to demonstrate the react framework and functional components along with unit testing framework (Jest and React-testing-library).

- Use of Jest and react-testing-library for unit testing
- Built in React by keeping the components testable
- Understanding of state management in react using useState hook
- Keeping user friendly UI by keeping the component sizes and colours consistent
